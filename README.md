# Personal-Portfolio

As developers we make tons of project, some of them to learn a new tool or framework, some of it to build or upgrade existing tools around us.

But let's be honest nothing is more special than building your first portfolio website.
It's a one-stop solution to demonstrate the competencies you would list on a resume or talk about in an interview â€” they allow you to show and not just tell.

During the job search your portflio will serve as the most relevant proof for your skills and abilities.

Welcome! to my first portfolio project.
